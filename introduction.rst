Developed by Luca Congedo (ing.congedoluca@gmail.com),
the **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open
source plugin for `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the
semi-automatic classification (also known as supervised classification) of
remote sensing images.
It provides several tools for the download of free images, the preprocessing,
the postprocessing, and the raster calculation.

The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of
intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic workflow
and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed also by people
whose main field is not remote sensing.

:guilabel:`SCP` exploits the parallel processing of the tools provided by
`Remotior Sensus <https://remotior-sensus.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_,
a Python package that allows for the processing of remote sensing images and
GIS data.

This **user manual** provides information about the :ref:`installation` of SPC
and the :ref:`interface`, with detailed information about all the functions.
In addition, the :ref:`remote_sensing` illustrates the basic concepts and
definitions which are required for using the :guilabel:`SCP`.

**Brief history:**

The first version of the :guilabel:`SCP` was developed by Luca Congedo in 2012
for the "ACC Dar Project" in order to create a tool for the classification of
land cover in an affordable and automatic fashion; following versions of
:guilabel:`SCP` were developed as personal commitment to the remote sensing
field and open source philosophy.
:guilabel:`SCP` version 6 was developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's PhD in
Landscape and Environment at Sapienza University of Rome.
:guilabel:`SCP` version 7 and version 8 as personal commitment to the remote
sensing field and open source philosophy.
