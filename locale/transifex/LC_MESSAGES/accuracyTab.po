"Several statistics are calculated such as overall accuracy, user's "
"accuracy, producer's accuracy, and Kappa hat. In particular, these "
"statistics are calculated according to the area based error matrix where "
"each element represents the estimated area proportion of each class. This"
" allows for estimating the unbiased user's accuracy and producer's "
"accuracy, the unbiased area of classes according to reference data, and "
"the standard error of area estimates."

"The output is an ``error raster`` that is a ``.tif`` file showing the "

"file containing the error matrix (i.e. a ``.csv`` file separated by tab) "
"is created with the same name defined for the ``.tif`` file."
