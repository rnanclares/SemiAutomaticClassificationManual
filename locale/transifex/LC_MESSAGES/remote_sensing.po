"There are several definitions of **GIS** (Geographic Information "
"Systems), which is not simply a program. In general, GIS are systems that"
" allow for the use of geographic information (data have spatial "
"coordinates). In particular, GIS allow for the view, query, calculation "
"and analysis of spatial data, which are mainly distinguished in raster or"
" vector data structures. Vector is made of objects that can be points, "
"lines or polygons, and each object can have one ore more attribute "
"values; a raster is a grid (or image) where each cell has an attribute "
"value (Fisher and Unwin, 2005). Several GIS applications use raster "
"images that are derived from remote sensing."

"Usually, remote sensing is the measurement of the energy that is emanated"
