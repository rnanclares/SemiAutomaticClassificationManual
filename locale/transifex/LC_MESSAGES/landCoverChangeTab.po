"The tab ``Land cover change`` allows for the comparison between two "
"classifications in order to assess land cover changes. Output is a ``land"
" cover change raster`` (i.e. a file .tif showing the changes in the map, "
"where each pixel represents a category of comparison (i.e. combinations) "
"between the two classifications, which is the ``ChangeCode`` in the land "
"cover change statistics) and a text file containing the land cover change"
" statistics (i.e. a file .csv separated by tab, with the same name "
"defined for the .tif file)."
