"This tab allows for calculating the spectral distance between every "
"corresponding pixel of two :guilabel:`band sets`. The output is a raster "
"containing the spectral distance of each pixel. Optionally, a threshold "
"can be defined for creating a binary raster (0-1) of values below and "
"above the threshold."

"This tool supports ``virtual raster output``; if the output file name "
"ends with ``.vrt`` then the output is created as virtual raster composed "
"of as many ``.tif`` files as the number of CPU threads defined in "
":ref:`system_processing`; for large rasters this can speed up the "
"process."
