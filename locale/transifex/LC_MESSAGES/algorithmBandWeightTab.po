"This tab allows for the definition of band weights that are useful for "
"improving the spectral separability of materials at certain wavelengths "
"(bands). During the classification process, band values and spectral "
"signature values are multiplied by the corresponding band weights, thus "
"modifying the spectral distances. A tab is displayed for every "
":ref:`band_set_tab`."
