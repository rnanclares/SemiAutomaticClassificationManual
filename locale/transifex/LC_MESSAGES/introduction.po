"Developed by `Luca Congedo "
"<http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca_Congedo>`_, the **Semi-"
"Automatic Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open source"
" plugin for `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the semi-"
"automatic classification (also known as supervised classification) of "
"remote sensing images. It provides several tools for the download of free"
" images, the preprocessing, the postprocessing, and the raster "
"calculation (please see :ref:`other_0`). All the main tools are designed "
"for parallel processing."

"The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of "
"intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic "
"workflow and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed"
" also by people whose main field is not remote sensing."

"The first version of the :guilabel:`SCP` was developed by Luca Congedo in"
" 2012 for the \"ACC Dar Project\" in order to create a tool for the "
"classification of land cover in an affordable and automatic fashion; "
"following versions of :guilabel:`SCP` were developed as personal "
"commitment to the remote sensing field and open source philosophy. "
":guilabel:`SCP` version 6 was developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's "
"PhD in Landscape and Environment at Sapienza University of Rome. "
":guilabel:`SCP` version 7 as personal commitment to the remote sensing "
"field and open source philosophy."
