"This tab allows for the calculation of a cross classification raster and "
"matrix. Classification is compared to a reference raster or reference "
"vector (which is automatically converted to raster). This is useful for "
"calculating the area for every combination between reference classes and "
"classification values. If a vector is selected as reference, it is "
"possible to choose a field describing class values."

"The output is a ``cross raster`` that is a ``.tif`` file where pixel "
"values represent the categories of comparison (i.e. combinations "
"identified by the ``CrossMatrixCode``) between the classification and "
"reference. Also, a text file containing the cross matrix (i.e. a ``.csv``"
" file separated by tab) is created with the same name defined for the "
"``.tif`` file."
