"This tab allows for the conversion of **Sentinel-2** images Level-1C to "
"the physical measure of Top Of Atmosphere reflectance (TOA), or the "
"application of a simple atmospheric correction using the DOS1 method "
"(Dark Object Subtraction 1), which is an image-based technique (for more "
"information about conversion to TOA and DOS1 correction, see "
":ref:`conversion_to_reflectance`). This tool can also convert "
"**Sentinel-2** images Level-2A from DN to reflectance values."
